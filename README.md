## Project Title
Green Consulting
## Description
I made this webpage on 17.05.23 as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path. The project requirements were to use all skills learned so far in HTML and CSS to create a landing page for an imagined company. Some skills used: semantic HTML to create header, nav, main and footer elements; links to each section of the page; flexbox with images that resize/wrap as needed; a fixed header.
